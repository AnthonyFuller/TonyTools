# Third-Party Libraries

Various open-source third-party libraries are used for my projects, and where the library allows, they have all been included using CMake's [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) feature. A list of all third-party libraries used can be found below:

- [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (including the DLL through bit7z)
- [argparse](https://github.com/p-ranav/argparse)
- [bit7z](https://github.com/rikyoz/bit7z)
- [DirectXTex](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex)
- [hash library](https://github.com/stbrumme/hash-library)
- [lz4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4/)
- [libmorton](https://github.com/Forceflow/libmorton/)
- [nlohmann json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
- [ordered-map](https://github.com/Tessil/ordered-map)
- [ZHMTools](https://github.com/OrfeasZ/ZHMTools)

I understand that a huge amount of work goes into maintaining these libraries, and all my thanks go to the contributors of all the above projects.
